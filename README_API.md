# EventTrackerProject

### Description

This project is designed to show learning about creating an HTML/JavaScript front end for a RESTful API.  For this project, we created a single-page application (SPA) that uses JavaScript to dynamically update the page with CRUD calls to the API we built last week.

***CHOREX*** (_Chore Exchange_) is a database that tracks chores. One table contains a list of chores with their associated payments for completion. A second table is the ledger, where a user makes an entry for the name of the person who completed the chore, the ID associated with the chore (for a many-to-one lookup), and the amount paid (which can be higher if the chore is based on hours worked).

For the project this week, I only used the Chore table for showing the ability to perform CRUD actions.

### Topics covered in Week 12:

- JavaScript integration into HTML for dynamic RESTful calls and JSON-based information display to a page.

### Technologies Used

- HTML & JavaScript
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench (for creating the database and populating basic content)
- Java
- Spring Tool Suite
- Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API), which replaced our previous work on JPA using Data Access Objects (DAO)
- Postman (for HTTP request testing)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, for formatting data within Postman)
- Git
- GitHub
- Markdown (for README.md)
- Slack
- Zoom
- Browser (Chrome-focused)
- Unix/Linux Terminal
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)

### Lessons Learned

Vanilla JavaScript is harder than I thought.  A couple of years ago, I started to learn JS through Jonah Schmedtmann's course on Udemy, which is highly recommended. We learned far more in this one week than I learned in many weeks before, and the depth of the language is more complex than I expected.  After a week of frustration, it was extremely gratifying to feel the accomplishment of creating a full-CRUD application with JS.

It's amazing to see how far we've come in three and a half months.  Going from the beginnings of Java all the way to creating a basic full-stack single-page application is extremely empowering.  I am grateful to Skill Distillery for giving me the challenge and opportunity to grow.

I enjoy front-end development more than back-end develpoment.  I enjoy creating tools that reduce the barrier to entry for many people at once.  While the real power of an application is what's under the hood, the ergonomic considerations of front-end development are extremely well suited to my past experiences.
